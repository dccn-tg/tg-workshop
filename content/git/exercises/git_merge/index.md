In the [previous exercise](../git_branch/) you have pushed your Christmas gift tips to a repository hosed on GitHub. You want your tips to be added to the final tip list that is a version maintained in the _main_ branch.

In this exercise, you will create a pull request, ask someone to review your changes and eventually get your changes merged into the main branch.

## Create pull request

On [the repository page](https://github.com/dccn-tg/tg-workshop), select the __Code__ tab and make switch to your branch as shown in the screenshot below.

In the branch, you will notice a panel summaring the differences between this branch and the main branch.  At the right of the panel, you see a "Contribute" button.  Click on it and select "Open pull request".
